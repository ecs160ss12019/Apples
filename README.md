# Apples - Super Breakout

We are team Apples and we will be recreating our version of Atari's Super Breakout. Our team members are:

The player is a bat trapped in an alternate dimension and is trying to get back home to Davis. In order to get back home, the player has to destroy all the obstacles that appear in their way.
